# Integrations

Welcome to the Integrations section of our Advanced Admin Panel for Go. This page provides detailed information on how 
to integrate the admin panel with various ORMs and web frameworks. If you're looking to get started quickly, please

Our admin panel supports a wide range of integrations to suit your project's needs. The Integrations section is divided 
into two main subpages:

- [ORM Integrations](ORM.md)
- [Web Framework Integrations](Web.md)

Each subpage includes guides for supported integrations and comprehensive instructions on building custom integrations.
