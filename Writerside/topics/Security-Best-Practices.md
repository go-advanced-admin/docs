## Introduction

Security should be a primary concern when deploying an admin panel. By following best practices, you can mitigate risks 
and protect your application.

## Authentication and Authorization

Ensure that only authorized users can access the admin panel.

### Implement Authentication

- **Secure Authentication Methods**: Use strong authentication mechanisms like OAuth2 or JWT.
- **Session Management**: Properly manage user sessions, tokens, and handle session expiration.

### Implement Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assign roles to users (e.g., admin, editor) and define permissions for each 
role.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Use user attributes and resource attributes for fine-grained control.

## Implementing a Permission Checker

The admin panel relies on a permission checker function to enforce authorization.

### Example Permission Checker

```go
permissionFunc := func(req admin.PermissionRequest, ctx interface{}) (bool, error) {
    user := GetUserFromContext(ctx)
    if user == nil {
        return false, nil
    }
    // Implement logic based on req.Action, req.AppName, req.ModelName, etc.
    switch *req.Action {
    case admin.ReadAction:
        return user.HasReadPermission(req), nil
    case admin.CreateAction:
        return user.HasCreatePermission(req), nil
    // Handle other actions
    default:
        return false, nil
    }
}
```

- **Validate Inputs**: Ensure all input parameters are validated and sanitized.
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant the minimum necessary permissions to users.

## Protecting Against Common Web Vulnerabilities

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Escape Output**: Use proper output encoding in templates to prevent injection of malicious scripts.
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Define CSP headers to restrict sources of content.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- **Use CSRF Tokens**: Implement CSRF protection in forms and state-changing requests.

### SQL Injection

- **Parameterized Queries**: Ensure ORM queries use parameterized inputs to prevent injection.

### Open Redirects

- **Validate Redirect URLs**: Ensure that any redirects are to allowed and expected URLs.

## Securing HTTP Connections

- **Use HTTPS**: Encrypt data in transit by serving the admin panel over HTTPS.
- **HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Implement HSTS headers to enforce secure connections.

## Data Validation and Sanitization

- **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the server side.
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode data before rendering in templates or sending in responses.

## Logging and Monitoring

- **Audit Logs**: Keep logs of user actions for auditing purposes.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools to detect and alert on suspicious activities.

## Regular Updates

- **Update Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date to include the latest security patches.
- **Security Audits**: Regularly audit your application for security vulnerabilities.
